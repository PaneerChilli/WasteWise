# WasteWise
WasteWise is a lightweight web app that helps people quickly find the right bin and keep recyclables clean and dry ♻️. Includes search, item pages, and clear do/avoid rules.
### reminders.html (Future Scope)

This page is a placeholder for future enhancements.  
It is intended to store **checklists, user reminders, and waste‑sorting tips** that may be developed into an interactive reminder/notification feature later.  

Currently, `reminders.html` is **not linked** in the main application flow and is excluded from the core submission functionality, but is retained in the repository for future development plans.
